Sound Scanner and FFT Analyzer
Due to a new project in the company Iâ€™ve been working in, we have been engaged in a project which should implement pattern recognition to detect whether an in-use gearbox works well or not.

We connect the sensor to the microphone input directly with the assumption of resembling the outcome of a microphone and a vibration sensor.
